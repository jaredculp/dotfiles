# dotfiles üè†

These are my dotfiles, because there's no place like `$HOME`.

I use:
* [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) to manage symlinks
* [vim](https://vim.org) as my $EDITOR
* [fish](https://fishshell.com) as my $TERM
* [base-16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) as my colorscheme

Clone the repository:
```
git clone http://github.com/jaredculp/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

And `./bootstrap.sh` your machine!
