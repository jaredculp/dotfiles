# dotfiles üè†

These are my dotfiles, because there's no place like `$HOME`.

I use:
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) to bootstrap
* [vim](https://vim.org) as my $EDITOR
* [tmux](https://tmux.github.io) as my terminal multiplexer
* [zsh](https://zsh.org) with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) as my $TERM
* [homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install shit

Clone the repository:
```
git clone http://github.com/jaredculp/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

And `make`!
