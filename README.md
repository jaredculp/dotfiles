# dotfiles üè†

These are my dotfiles, because there's no place like `$HOME`.

I use:
* [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage symlinks
* [vim](https://vim.org) as my $EDITOR
* [zsh](https://zsh.org) with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as my $TERM

Clone the repository:
```
git clone http://github.com/jaredculp/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

And `./bootstrap.sh` your machine!
